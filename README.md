This project involves building and deploying a functional realtor website that simplifies buying, selling, and investing in real estate while providing financial assistance. The platform will feature an “About Us” section, a Resources tab for buyers, sellers, investors, and those needing financial aid, and a media section with up-to-date property listings. Key technologies include PostgreSQL for database management, Visual Studio Code for development, and Adobe Dreamweaver for design. GitHub will support collaboration and version control. Browser compatibility will be tested on Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox to ensure a seamless user experience. This project aims to deliver a professional, user-friendly platform for diverse real estate needs.
